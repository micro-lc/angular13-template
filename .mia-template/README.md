## Summary

%CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION%

## Local development

First thing you need to do is install the dependencies. Enable Yarn running 

```sh
corepack enable
```

(or install it as a global dependency with `npm i -g yarn` for Node < 16.9.0), and run 

```sh
yarn install
```

Once you have the dependencies in place, run

```sh
yarn start
```

to spin up the application.

Tests can be run with

```sh
yarn coverage
```

### Build

To make the internal routing work in micro-lc, a custom script that removes the `<base>` tag from the generated HTML has
to be executed at the end of the build process.

If you don't whish to execute this step, simply change the build script in the `package.json`:

```diff
- 8 "build": "ng build && node plugins/post-html.js",
+ 8 "build": "ng build",
```

> **Warning**
>
> If you change the output directory, remember to change line 4 of the script (located in `plugins/post-html.js`) accordingly.

## Use in micro-lc

Applications build with this template can be used as-is in micro-lc as [parcels](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels).

An example configuration may be:

```json5
{
  "applications": {
    "angular13-parcel": {
      "integrationMode": "parcel",
      "route": "./angular13-parcel/", // <-- must have the ending "/", should have the starting "."
      "entry": "/my-micro-lc-angular13-parcel/", // <-- must have the ending "/"
      "injectBase": true // <-- must be "true" if hash routing is not used
    }
  }
}
```

### Internal routing

The internal routing of the application is already set up to work in micro-lc, meaning that the base url of the internal
routes is dynamically computed on the bases of micro-lc `<base>`, as explained in the 
[official documentation](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels/#injectbase).

> **Note**
>
> If you whish to use a hash router in your application, change `app-routing.module.ts` file as such:
> 
> ```diff
> - 17 imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
> + 17 imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true })],
> 
> - 19 providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl() }]
> + 19
> ```

### Assets

To correctly load assets in micro-lc, they should be put in `src/assets/` folder, and referenced using the `assetUrl`
[pipe](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#pipe).

A running example can be found in the `Home` component:

```html
<img alt="logo" class="app-logo" [src]="'angular-logo.svg' | assetUrl" />
```

### `zone.js`

Angular applications need [`zone.js`](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/zone.js) library to run, which
is not bundled in micro-lc. Therefore, you need to import it as a `<script>` in you micro-lc entrypoint **before** any
micro-lc related module.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>

  [...]

  <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/zone.js@0.13.0/dist/zone.min.js"></script>

  <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@micro-lc/orchestrator@latest/dist/micro-lc.production.js"></script>
</head>

[...]

</html>
```

> **Warning**
>
> `zone.js` is also imported in the entrypoint of this application to make it work in development mode. Whereas it is
> advisable to remove it before bundling for production, the import it can be kept as long as the version matches the one
> imported in micro-lc.
